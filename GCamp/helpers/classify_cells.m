%   Classifies cells mapped between MD1 and MD2 into categories: 1) good
%   mapped cells, those that become silent in the 2nd session, those that
%   are new in the 2nd session, and those that are overlapping by more than
%   the overlap_thresh but ARENT'T mapped between the two and thus might be
%   the same cells miscategorized as new or silent. overlap_thresh sets the
%   level for ambiguous mappings (i.e. 0.25 means cells must have <= 25%
%   overlapping pixels with their nearest neighbor to be considered silent,
%   nan means no good silent/new cells - all get thrown into ambig_silent
%   and ambig_new).
