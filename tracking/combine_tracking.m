% camera fritzing out, cord needing untangling, etc.) and combines them
% into one session that matches up with the fluorescence trace...NOTE: you
% should probably check and make sure this has been combined
% properly...e.g. does the first valid point in the second session
% correspond to the appropriate frame in the FT trace?)

%   INPUTS - Need to be entered in the same order that the movie was
%   concatenated.
%
%   FTframes: the number of frames in each fluorescence movie - get from

%   Cineplex file, dumped into a structure variable for the appropriate sessions.
